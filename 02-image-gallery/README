Picture Gallery!

Object of the exercise is to familiarize ourselves with writing simple web apps in Java.

You will find a set of pictures in the folder ../pictures-at-an-exhibition.

- First stage: import the project in Eclipse and run it.  Open the browser at http://localhost:8080/ and you should see the application.  You might have to correct a pathname to see the picture though.

- Second stage: change the application so that it displays an HTML unordered list (i.e. with bullet points) of the filenames of all pictures in the ../pictures-at-an-exhibition folder.  At this stage you may leave the pathname hardcoded in the Java code.  You should see

  * boccioni.lastrada.jpg
  * g.de_chirico_la_torre_rossa.jpg
  * joie.jpg
  * le-nord-sud.jpg
  
- Third stage: change the application so that when I visit http://localhost:8080/joie.jpg I see the corresponding picture (no HTML, just the picture)

- Fourth stage: change the application so that it shows the actual pictures under the names of the files.  

- Fifth stage: change the application so that it reads the .properties files and shows the titles and captions for each picture.

- Sixth stage: (optional) change the app so that it shows a thumbnail for each picture.  When I click the thumbnail, it should show the full-size picture.
